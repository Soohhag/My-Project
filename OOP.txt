2. what is class?
-> Class is a collection of attributes/properties and methods
-> Class is a collection of objects
-> Technically, class is a user-defined datatype
-> In python everything is object here below the example
	(x=10 is int class) (y=[] is a list class)
	print(type(x))
	print(type(y))


4. Constractruct and types of constractruat
-> magic method print(student1.__dict__) akta object er modde ki ki ache seta dekhte pabo
-> 3types of constructor
	prameterized constructor
	non-parameterized constructor
	default constructor

5. self variable
-> self is a variable which contains memory rafarence of current object in heap memory
example: student1 = Student(student1, name, age)


7. built in class function for data
-> getattr(object_name, attribute_name)
-> setattr(object_name, attribute_name, new_value)
-> delattr(object_name, attribute_name)
-> hasattr(object_name, attribute_name)
example: setattr(student1, 'name', 'sohagmia')
print(student1.__dict__)

8. built in class attributes
-> __dict__:- Dictionary containing class namespace
-> __doc__:- Class documentation string.
-> __name__:- class Name
-> __module__:- Module name in which class is defined
-> __bases__:- List of base classes

9. isinstance(student1, Student): True return korbe
	if isinstance(student1, Student):
		pass

10. instance variable and instance method

11. class variables
-> Variables made for entire class(All objects)
-> Only one copy is created and distributed to all objects
-> Modification in class variable impact on all objects.
	-> class mathod
		@classmethod
		def get_company_name(cls):
			cls.company_name

12. setter method and getter method

13. types of method
-> instance methods
-> class methods
-> static methods


18. types of inheritence
-> Single inheritance
-> Multi-level inheritance
-> Hierarchical inheritance
-> Multiple inheritance
-> Hybrid inheritance
-> cyclic inheritance

38. class base decorators
2types of decorators
*function base decorators
*class base decorators
python has 3 built in decorators
* @classmethod
* @staticmethod
* @property
class Decorators(object):
	def __init__(self, func):
		self.function = func
	
	def __call__(self, a, b):
		result = self.function(a, b)
		return result**2
		

@Decorators
def add(a, b):
	return a + b



42. Abstraction - Interface
# python er modde biult in Abstraction class ney kintu amra (abc) module er 
maddome abstraction implementation korte pari.

* A class which contains one or more abstract methods and concrete method
* Abstract class must have at least one abstract method.
* An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other class.

Keep in mind:-
* You can't instantiate abstract classes.
* Abstract class requires at least one method abstract.
* All abstract methods present in abstract class must be implemented in child classes.

Uses of abstraction
* when we have large code and functionaliies.
* Your abstract class is like an API for other subclasses
* used when a third party is going to provide implementations.
* when we have different implementations for different objects for same component
* for creating interfaces
